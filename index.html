        <h2>A poetic crash course on the history of color</h2>
        <p><e>A version of this essay was presented at <a href="https://design.google/library/span2019">SPAN2019</a> during the "Hue & Glue: Hands-On Color Theory" workshop. Read to the end to find instructions for an exercise that explores the relationship between color and light.</e></p>

        The color you see is only the color you think you see. Your interpretation of light landing on a surface depends on your frame of reference and your frame of mind &#8212; both can be altered at the speed of light.

        When I&#39;m overwhelmed in a crowd I distract myself by looking for as many red-colored objects as I can. Red is not typically a calming color, especially if you&#39;re staring at miles of brake lights in traffic, but it&#39;s really easy for me to see. Red becomes the most dominant thing on my mind.

        Humans have used red since the neolithic era, as seen in the prehistoric cave drawings; When developing languages, red is typically the color named first after black and white. It&#39;s now used so frequently in advertising—because it attracts the most attention—that people have learned to ignore it. The ad industry has successfully made a highly visible color…invisible.

        In grade school, I learned that yellow was the most soothing to color with when I brought the expensive markers I wasn&#39;t allowed to use at home to school. I colored in a picture of Paddington wearing a raincoat well enough for my teacher to hang it on the wall for parent-teacher day. The comfort I experienced from quietly meeting the black lines with a high-contrast yellow, disappeared as I waited for my mother to find me out.
