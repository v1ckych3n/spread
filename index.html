        <h1>Everyday Color Theory</h1>
        <h2>A poetic crash course on the history of color</h2>
        <p><em>A version of this essay was presented at <a href="https://design.google/library/span2019">SPAN2019</a> during the "Hue & Glue: Hands-On Color Theory" workshop. Read to the end to find instructions for an exercise that explores the relationship between color and light.</em></p>

        The color you see is only the color you think you see. Your interpretation of light landing on a surface depends on your frame of reference and your frame of mind &#8212; both can be altered at the speed of light.

        When I&#39;m overwhelmed in a crowd I distract myself by looking for as many red-colored objects as I can. Red is not typically a calming color, especially if you&#39;re staring at miles of brake lights in traffic, but it&#39;s really easy for me to see. Red becomes the most dominant thing on my mind.

        "Someone who speaks of the character of a colour is always thinking of just one particular way it is used." &#8212; Ludwig Wittgenstein

        Humans have used red since the neolithic era, as seen in the prehistoric cave drawings; When developing languages, red is typically the color named first after black and white. It&#39;s now used so frequently in advertising—because it attracts the most attention—that people have learned to ignore it. The ad industry has successfully made a highly visible color…invisible.

        In grade school, I learned that yellow was the most soothing to color with when I brought the expensive markers I wasn&#39;t allowed to use at home to school. I colored in a picture of <a href="https://ecoloringpage.com/holding-and-umbrella-paddington-bear-coloring-page/">Paddington wearing a raincoat</a> well enough for my teacher to hang it on the wall for parent-teacher day. The comfort I experienced from quietly meeting the black lines with a high-contrast yellow, disappeared as I waited for my mother to find me out.

        In her piece commemorating a decade of internet colors, designer <a href="https://rhizome.org/editorial/2020/jan/06/laurel-schwulsts-decade-in-internet/">Laurel Schwulst</a> reflects that “yellow tries to show you the way” in Google Maps. Artist <a href="https://www.ianwhittlesea.net/exhibitions_pages/ex_invisible/ex_invisible.html">Ian Whittlesea</a> describes yellow as the easiest to mentally conjure in his seven breathing exercises to become invisible—inspired by the literature of Rosicrucianism, theosophy, and esoteric yoga. According to Whittlesea, Indigo is the most difficult color to generate and green can be the most difficult to keep stable.

        Colors can be hard to see. To the chemist John Dalton, red, orange, yellow, and green all appeared the same. The rest of the color spectrum appeared as gradients of blue and purple. Dalton went on to write the first scientific paper on the subject of color blindness, <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Extraordinary_Facts_Relating_to_the_Visi.html?id=jYkyAQAAMAAJ">"Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colours"</a> in 1798.

        Ludwig Wittgenstein — the Austrian philosopher who popularized the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit%E2%80%93duck_illusion">rabbit-duck illusion</a> as a means of describing two different ways of seeing — wrote in <em>Remarks on Colour</em>, that “not every deviation from the norm must be a blindness.” He pointed out that the “normal” sighted and the color-blind do not have the same concept of color-blindness.
