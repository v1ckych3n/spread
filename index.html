        <h1>Everyday Color Theory</h1>
        <h2>A poetic crash course on the history of color</h2>
        <p><em>A version of this essay was presented at <a href="https://design.google/library/span2019">SPAN2019</a> during the "Hue & Glue: Hands-On Color Theory" workshop. Read to the end to find instructions for an exercise that explores the relationship between color and light.</em></p>

        The color you see is only the color you think you see. Your interpretation of light landing on a surface depends on your frame of reference and your frame of mind &#8212; both can be altered at the speed of light.

        When I&#39;m overwhelmed in a crowd I distract myself by looking for as many red-colored objects as I can. Red is not typically a calming color, especially if you&#39;re staring at miles of brake lights in traffic, but it&#39;s really easy for me to see. Red becomes the most dominant thing on my mind.

    <p>
        Humans have used red since the neolithic era, as seen in the prehistoric cave drawings; When developing languages, red is typically the color named first after black and white. It&#39;s now used so frequently in advertising—because it attracts the most attention—that people have learned to ignore it. The ad industry has successfully made a highly visible color…invisible.

        In grade school, I learned that yellow was the most soothing to color with when I brought the expensive markers I wasn&#39;t allowed to use at home to school. I colored in a picture of <a href="https://ecoloringpage.com/holding-and-umbrella-paddington-bear-coloring-page/">Paddington wearing a raincoat</a> well enough for my teacher to hang it on the wall for parent-teacher day. The comfort I experienced from quietly meeting the black lines with a high-contrast yellow, disappeared as I waited for my mother to find me out.

        In her piece commemorating a decade of internet colors, designer <a href="https://rhizome.org/editorial/2020/jan/06/laurel-schwulsts-decade-in-internet/">Laurel Schwulst</a> reflects that “yellow tries to show you the way” in Google Maps. Artist <a href="https://www.ianwhittlesea.net/exhibitions_pages/ex_invisible/ex_invisible.html">Ian Whittlesea</a> describes yellow as the easiest to mentally conjure in his seven breathing exercises to become invisible—inspired by the literature of Rosicrucianism, theosophy, and esoteric yoga. According to Whittlesea, Indigo is the most difficult color to generate and green can be the most difficult to keep stable.

    <blockquote>
        "Colors can be hard to see."
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Colors can be hard to see. To the chemist John Dalton, red, orange, yellow, and green all appeared the same. The rest of the color spectrum appeared as gradients of blue and purple. Dalton went on to write the first scientific paper on the subject of color blindness, <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Extraordinary_Facts_Relating_to_the_Visi.html?id=jYkyAQAAMAAJ">"Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colours"</a> in 1798.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ludwig Wittgenstein — the Austrian philosopher who popularized the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit%E2%80%93duck_illusion">rabbit-duck illusion</a> as a means of describing two different ways of seeing — wrote in <em>Remarks on Colour</em>, that “not every deviation from the norm must be a blindness.” He pointed out that the “normal” sighted and the color-blind do not have the same concept of color-blindness.
    </p>

    <p>
        People with decreased ability to differentiate between hues experience color through a series of judgments. My colleague, for example, explained that for red, green, and brown to function for him, he has to consider their context. These judgments may be “wrong” when they need to be “right”; Like the order of a traffic light, the alternating red and green battery light on a vape pen, or the order of a color legend matching the clockwise color placement in a pie chart.

    <p>
        “If one says &#39;red&#39; and there are fifty people listening, it can be expected that there will be fifty reds in their minds,” wrote the artist and educator Josef Albers. We see fifty different reds because we each perceive and experience color differently.

        The artist Wassily Kandinsky could practically hear and taste color because of his synesthesia. To him yellow was a trumpet&#39;s C note, black was the end of things, “blue is cold, red is a square, and green is a feeling,” as summarized by the painter Amy Sillman who called Kandinsky&#39;s philosophy a kind of color astrology in her essay <a href="https://servinglibrary.org/journal/11/drug-poison-remedy-talisman-cosmetic-intoxicant">“Drug, Poison, Remedy, Talisman, Cosmetic, Intoxicant.”</a>

    <p>
        In 1810, writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe decided that an equilateral triangle was the most effective form for his ideas on the psychological effect of colors. This new way of organizing color came about a hundred years after Sir Isaac Newton first arranged colors on a disk, to create an early form of the color wheel. The triangle served Goethe as a modular system of desirable and dissonant color relationships that evoked vibes like serious, mighty, serene, and melancholic.

    <!-- nature of surface section -->
    <p>
        Colors can change depending on the nature of surfaces, like the atmospheric oxidation of the Statue of Liberty&#39;s plating from shiny copper to verdigris (a bluish-green patina). In 1906, the Army Corps of Engineers vetoed a proposal from the United States Congress to restore the statue, concluding that the patina protecting the underlying metal from corrosion “softened the outlines, and made it beautiful.”
    </p>

    <p>
        We can see those softened outlines because light helps us discern forms. I find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vantablack">Vantablack</a>&#8212;one of the darkest known substances, absorbing 99.96% of visible light—unsettling. As <a href="https://www.kassiastclair.com/">Kassia St Clair</a> explains in <em>The Secret Lives of Color</em> “black is an expression of light, in this case, it&#39;s absence.” My eyes hunt for the surface, and Vantablack leaves nothing to see.
    </p>

    <p>
        White surfaces reflect and scatter visible light, and according to Wittgenstein “very few people have seen pure white.” In the essay <a href="http://pdf-objects.com/files/In-Praise-of-Shadows-Junichiro-Tanizaki.pdf">“In Praise of Shadows”</a> on traditional Japanese aesthetics, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jun%27ichir%C5%8D_Tanizaki">Jun&#39;ichirō Tanizaki</a> wrote that “western paper turns away light, while [Japanese] paper seems to take it in, to envelope it gently, like the soft surface of a first snowfall.” If you take a piece of computer paper, that you know is white in its normal surroundings, and place it next to snow, the paper may appear grey. A white can be light grey in poor lighting or a light grey in good lighting.
    </p>

    <p>
        Or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dress">dress</a> can look black and blue under yellow light and white and gold in blue light.

    <!-- Purkinje Shift section -->
    <p>
        In full sunlight, the petals of a red flower appear bright red against duller green leaves. At dusk, the red flowers become darker while blue flowers appear brighter than they did in full daylight. This effect is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purkinje_effect"><em>Purkinje shift</em></a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Albers based his career on studying these kinds of shifts in color. In his book <em>Interaction of Color</em>, first published in 1963, he created color theory exercises that could make “colors lie”—as Tamara Shopsin put it in her essay <a href="https://www.servinglibrary.org/journal/11/homage-to-an-homage-of-an-homage">"Homage to an Homage of an Homage."</a> By itself, a color appears dominant, but when placed next to an even stronger hue, we can see its more diminished true nature.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sixty years before <em>Interaction of Color</em>, the artist and historian Emily Noyes Vanderpoel published color studies in her forgotten book, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sacredbones/color-problems-a-book-by-emily-noyes-vanderpoel"><em>Color Problems: A Practical Manual for the Lay Student of Color</em></a>. Her work predicted trends that wouldn&#39;t occur for several decades, like the concentric square format of Albers&#39;s <em>Homage to the Square</em>.
